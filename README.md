# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2021

## Theme
Our group decided that the best way to represent the theme would be a 2D platformer style game where the goal is to lose as many lives as you can.

## Game Play
The objective of this game is to lose as many lives as fast as you can.

## Impediments
Our game was wiped twice and we had to restart multiple times, which led to us having to use multiple repositories, this is our third. 

## Implementation
Built using Godot 3.2.3, Includes a user-controlled player, includes camera, a menu
